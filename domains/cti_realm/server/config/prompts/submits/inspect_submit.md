Please provide your final detection output in valid JSON format with the following JSON structure, no extra text:

{% raw %}{{"sigma_rule": "<YAML string with \\n for line breaks>", "kql_query": "<working KQL query string>", "query_results": [{{"column1": "value1", "column2": "value2"}}, {{"column1": "value3", "column2": "value4"}}]}}{% endraw %}

Requirements:
- **sigma_rule**: Must be a valid Sigma detection rule in YAML format
- **kql_query**: Must be a tested and working KQL query
- **query_results**: Must be the actual array returned by execute_kql_query. Each object is a database row where keys are column names from the query results and values are the data in those columns.

Ensure all components are properly tested and validated before submission.
